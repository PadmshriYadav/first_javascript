//Making an API call---->process of sending a request to a server to get a response. 
//u send a message to the API's server. This request typically includes the API's URL
// pre-built objects and classes provided by the browser.like XMLHttpRequest

<!-- const car = new Object();, you are creating a generic, empty object using the built-in Object class. You then add properties like make, model, and year to it.const car = new Object();

car.make = 'Toyota';
car.model = 'Camry';
car.year = 2022;

console.log(car.make); // 'Toyota' -->
 <!--XMLHttpRequest Class: This is a specific, specialized class for a single purpose. It comes pre-packaged with all the tools needed for that task. It's like a specialized toolâ€”a wrench, not a customizable box.  -->
